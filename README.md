# Data-Driven_Businesses_with_SQL_and_Tableau

**Summary**
This project explores whether Eniac, an e-commerce company specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, should partner with Magist to expand its business into the Brazilian market. By analyzing Magist's database using SQL and creating visual insights with Tableau, this study addresses key concerns: Magist's compatibility with Eniac's high-end tech products and the efficiency of its delivery system. The recommendations aim to support Eniac's strategic scaling efforts while maintaining its core values.

**Languages and Libraries Used**
- SQL: Used to explore and analyze Magist's database for actionable insights.
- Tableau: Created interactive dashboards and visualizations for data-driven storytelling.
- MySQL Workbench: Managed database imports, exports, and queries.

**Key Learnings**

1. Technical Skills:
- Proficient use of SQL to handle complex joins, aggregations, and CASE statements for data exploration.
- Tableau proficiency in creating explanatory visualizations and dashboards for non-technical audiences.
- Effective management of large datasets, including exporting and linking them for visual analysis.

2. Business Acumen:
- Understanding e-commerce challenges in entering new markets, especially logistics and product positioning.
- Insight into Brazilian e-commerce trends and competitors.

3. Communication:
- Translating technical findings into a compelling story for stakeholders.
- Structuring presentations to align data insights with business strategy.

**Challenges Overcame**

1. Database Documentation:
- Overcame the lack of documentation in the database by deducing relationships between tables through schema 
  exploration and test queries.
2. Data Complexity:
- Managed large, unstructured data with unclear relationships and created meaningful connections to answer business 
  questions.
3. Time Constraints:
- Synthesized insights into a concise 5-minute presentation, balancing technical depth and simplicity for decision- 
  makers.
  
**Additional Reflections**
- Market Analysis: Research into the Brazilian market underscored the importance of understanding local customer 
  behavior and delivery expectations.

- Strategic Decisions: The partnership with Magist is a potential stepping stone for Eniac to enter a high-growth 
  market, but it requires a careful balance of cost-efficiency and brand identity.

- Future Recommendations: Post-expansion, consider transitioning to an independent supply chain in Brazil once Eniac 
  establishes local brand awareness and operational stability.

This project highlights the critical role of data-driven decision-making in business expansion and showcases the value of combining technical skills with strategic vision.
